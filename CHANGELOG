OpenMesh 2.0 ( Rev  356 ):

* Core
- Improve computation of normals for poly meshes ( now the average normal is taken not the normal of one triangle)
- Avoid % Operator in normal calculation (triggers compiler error on vectors of size other than 3)
- Added status flag indicating that mesh reader duplicated primitives to avoid non-manifold configurations
- Setting associated handles of iterator types invalid if reference mesh contains none of the respective entities.
- Added halfedge colors

* IO
- PLY Reader: Avoid failure of file writing if face colors or face normals are requested for PLY files.

* Math
- Added missing include of string.h to VectorT.hh (Thanks to Justin Bronder for reporting this)
- Added some vector norm functions for L1 norm, and absolute mean,max,min(Thanks to Michal Nociar)

* Tools
- OpenMesh mesh dual generator added (Thanks to Clement Courbet for providing the code)
- Added Sqrt3InterpolatingSubdividerLabsikGreinerT and ModifiedButterFlyT (Thanks to ClÃ©ment Courbet for providing the code)

* Apps
- OpenMesh mesh dual generator application added (Thanks to Clement Courbet for providing the code)

* Documentation
- Added search engine
- Added treeview on the left
- Generate subpage structure to make treeview more organized 
- Enabled Doxygen stl support
- Fixed documentation for add_face and some other typos (Thanks to Yamauchi Hitoshi)
- Added preprocessor directives such that doxigen parses vectorT correctly

* Build System
- Copy Doc directories to installers
- Copy shared Qt Libs to build dir on windows
- Updated glew and glut finders
- Respect seperate settings for build types (release,debug,relwithdebinfo)
- Extend macros acg_append_files_recursive acg_append_files to not include files starting with a dot


OpenMesh 2.0-RC5 ( Rev  306 ):

* Core
- Fixed build error in function calc_dihedral_angle_fast
- Made iterators/circulators stl compliant
- Provide begin/end functions for circulators
- mostream crash fixed (Thanks to Adrian Secord for providing the patch)
- added colors to status flags for edges ( request_edge_color ... )
- Fixed issue with wrong normal scalar type when using integer points and float normals (Thanks to Clement Courbet for reporting this bug)

* Readers/Writers
- Fixed build error in STL writer
- Fixed and enhanced PLY reader to improve handling of unknown properties (Thanks to Michal Nociar for the patch)
- Fixed crash in Offreader with DOS line endings. (Thanks to Adrian Secord for the patch)
- Fixed obj readers for some files containing tabs

* Apps
- OpenMesh progressive mesh generator readded

- Updated tutorial on deleting geometry
- Examples for flipping and collapsing edges
- Fixed a lot of doxygen warnings
- Fixed some spellings

* Build System
- Fixed rpath issue when building and installing on MacOS
- Fixed install target for MacOS (headers where not copied due to bug in cmake)

OpenMesh 2.0-RC4 ( Rev 227 ):
* Core
- Added function for direct access to property vectors
- Fixed clear functions to swap vectors. This frees OpenMesh memory when clear is invoked.
- Fixed bug in handle() function when getting handle from given Halfedge (Reported by Rob Patro)
- Memory leak in assignment Operator (Reported by Meng Luan, Thanks to Ilya A. Kriveshko for the patch)

* Readers/Writers
- Fixed reading ply files with unknown properties
- Added support for texture coordinates in ply files
- Add additional interface to readers/writers to use streams directly (allows direct writing to a streams)
- OMFromat  -> Fixed empty template parameter issue under msvc
- OBJReader -> Fixed loading multiple objs with material files
- OBJWriter -> Fixed writing of normals, Missing / when skipping texture coordinates


* Build system
- Added missing c files
- Build shared and static version under linux (cmake)
- Added -DBUILD_APPS=OFF cmake flag to skip building of apps (cmake)
- Added install target (cmake)
- Added doc target (cmake)
- Added doc-install target (cmake)
- Generate sonames under linux (cmake)
- Debian build dir for building Debian packages (Thanks to Jean Pierre Charalambos)
- Package generator for windows. Builds an setup file containing precompiled static libs and includes for windows.
- Throw warning if a min or max macro is defined under windows and suggest NOMINMAX (Thanks to Ingo Esser)


* Documentation
- Updated Documentation Mainpage
- Updated properties tutorial to include all request_... functions
- Updates for build instructions
- Added Tutorial on deleting geometry
- Fixed Traits example
- Other minor fixes
- Added tutorials as compileable source code

* Misc
- Updated debian dir to build debs (Thanks to Jean Pierre Charalambos)


OpenMesh 2.0-RC3 ( Rev 138 ):

* License
- Relicense under LGPL v3 with additional exception for template inclusion

* Readers/Writers
- PLY writer fix ( thanks to Marc Hugi )
- PLY reader fix ( wrong parsing of uchar binary data )
- PLY reader warnings fix ( thanks to Ilya A. Kriveshko )
- OBJ Reader now stores texture information in additional Mesh properties
- OBJ reader/writer fixes

* Tools
- Smoother now respects feature primitives
- Decimater improvements and fixes ( thanks to Ilya A. Kriveshko )

* Build system:
- Updated directory structure 
- Changed libnames to libOpenMesh and libOpenMeshTools
- cmake support
- bugfixes to qmake build system
- Keep some basic ACGMake files around ( acgmake is deprecated!! We will not provide support for it! Please use cmake or qmake instead. )

* Other
- Fixed some warnings with latest gcc
- Per halfedge texture coordinates added 
- Extended functions to get available properties
